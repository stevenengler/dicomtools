   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to dicomtools' documentation!
======================================

The dicomtools package is designed to simplify many common DICOM processing steps, and is
based on the :mod:`pydicom` package. It's
designed primarily for research use. This code is still very basic and the structure will
likely change. It tries to somewhat follow the DICOM standard, or to at least avoid
vendor-specific attributes.
